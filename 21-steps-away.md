I am dead.

I am dead right at my career peak.

The problem here is that my soul doesn't reach heaven, rather it stays in the human world.

This city is strange; I walk around, but can't figure out where it is. The building style here is quite simple, but got a taste of towns in fairy tales. There are not many people on the street, but they all look quite friendly, except sometimes some of them like to walk across my body without a care.

I look at the street nameplate, and the name board on the building, can't find any clue.

Maybe I need to walk farther, so I would know where it is. Therefore, I walk along the building toward the road, when I was nearly reach the crossroads, Shit! My foot kicked on something, and I almost fall down. I got my balance back, and step forward again, however, there is an invisible wall that restrict me from moving forward. I try to push that invisible wall, but no use. Finally, I can only walk along the rim of the invisible wall, to see where it goes. I turn to the right, my left hand touches the invisible wall, and my feet step forward slowly, my body comes across the street, across the building, across the cars, across the passengers, and then I return to the same place.

I realized that I can only move inside a small circle.

Is that because I did some bad thing when I was still alive?

I walk along the invisible wall again, carefully count my steps, and sometimes give way to the impolite passengers, 1,2,3....10...50...100...132, 132 steps, this circle has a circumference of 132 steps, therefore...it is...21, the radius is 21! I smile proudly, the mathematical formula that we learned seems still got some kind of use.

Some laughter of kids reaches my ears, "Is this your circle?"

"It's so ugly." A boy said.

I turn left and look at it, there are four children sitting on the street side, one of them is taking some stick-like object out from his bag. He opens the two legs of the stick, is that a ruler? I think that boy made the ruler by himself, cause there are two rough rounds of string on it. He puts the two legs of the ruler on the ground, one of the leg is tied with a chalk stick. Now I know it is a compass. There are still kids making this!? He draws the circle with the proudly smile, and other kids look at him with admiration. I can't help to laugh.

"Get away! Get away!" I turn back, a guy riding a bike shouting out loud toward my direction, his bike seems to have some kind of problem, rushing toward this way. I step backward subconsciously, and the bike passes in front of me, nearly striking me.

And suddenly there is something pushing on my back, and then I just step back to the original position.

Wait! I just got out the circle!? I turn back try to come across that boundary, but I can never do it again.

"Why is my circle not round?"

I turn back, seeing a girl looking at her circle depressively. "Idiot, you didn't keep the needle at the center, that's why the circle is going out." The boy grabs the compasses from the girl and is going to show her how to draw it.

Oh, I got it! I did step out the circle because the center has moved. So, there should be something at the center! I look toward the center of the circle; it's a four-story condominium, with a white wall. I walk toward the wall and keep counting the steps, after I walk through the cement wall; I reach a small shady room. There is a big bed in the room, a woman lying on it, her hair scatters on the pillow and her face burrows in the blanket. There is a small blue whale on the bed-stand. I know who she is now.

She took out two little small pieces of thing from her bag, put them on the table; which were two whales attracting and kissing each other by the magnet force inside, one was white, and one was blue.

"We can just put each of them on our bed-stands, and after we live together, then we can put them together." She blushes while she was saying it.

The woman just turns over on the bed, and reveals her sleeping face. I look at her, feeling quite tired, and then I lie down nearby her, to have a smooth sleep.

I hear the sound of teeth brushing, I mumble groggily, "Keep quiet, I want to sleep more." But the sound continues, I get up mistily, get down the bed, open my eyes that are nearly glued together, and find out that she sitting on the chair at the same time brushing her teeth and staring at the air.

Is she OK? My head moves closer to her head, shaking my hand in front of her eyes, obviously she can't see me, she keeps staring at the air. When I try to move closer to her, she suddenly stands up, and walks into the toilet, I follow her, she starts rinsing the mouth, then looks at the mirror and washes her face. I come closer, feeling her face is much more thinner, I can clearly see the edge of her bones. I want to see myself, so I turn to the mirror, but there is no me in the mirror.

The sadness begins to appear from my heart, I walk toward the mirror slowly, my body move through the basin, my right hand touches the mirror surface, and then through it, my whole face is on the mirror surface now, my whole body is going to enter the mirror; however, I still can't see myself.

I walk out the toilet desolately, she is standing in front of the dressing table combing her hair, and then she gradually takes off her bed-gown, showing her black underclothes; her body is much more skinny than I remember, I can see the structure of her ribs clearly. I walk closer to her, hug her furtively from the back, and then look at the mirror; there is only her in the mirror. She smiles to the mirror, and then takes on the shirt, puts on each button. My hands touch through her shirt, touch through her body, but can't feel anything.

She picks up the purse ready to get out, I walk towards her, follow her to the underground parking lot. We get in the car, she is sitting on the driver's seat, and i am sitting on the passenger seat. Since I graduated, I took over my dad's small business, and drive nearly every day, it has been a long time that I only sit in a car. She buckles her seat belt and steps on the accelerator. The car just moves through my body...I sit in air watching the car move away from me, Shit! I forgot that I don’t have a physical body now. I haven't figured out what I am going to do next, but my body starts to move, like something is dragging me, like riding a sled. And her car never moves away from my horizon.

I got it, my body can't move more than 21 steps away from her!

I speed up, and finally reach the car, get in the car, at this time, I try to control my body so that I can keep the same speed with the car. There are only a few cars on the road, and no big buildings. I think here is some small town far away from the city I lived, and when I reached here, was seven days after the accident.

Did she know about it? I start to think, and then turn to her, her face is quite pale.

The car gets into a university. After parked, she picks up her purse and gets out the car.

When she is walking, I am floating around her, at right, at left, on the top, sometimes I also try to float underground, but it is horrible; the extreme dirty sewerage.

She walks into the classroom, and I float in, floating is much more comfortable than walking. There are around thirty students at the room, she stands at the front, begins her lecture, so I find myself a seat. The school building is quite old, but it got everything inside the classroom; white board, computers, projector, microphone...and I start to miss my college life.

"Today we are going to start the new chapter, chapter 7, Belief and Consistency...” She grabs the microphone and moves between the white board and the screen, "First we look at the definition, Attitude, means...” I stare at her, the woman who talks with confidence suddenly turns to a girl who is eighteen, her voice is soft, with trembling, but she trys hard to maintain her breath in a constant rate, to control her tremble, and her eyes try to avoid my sight. She walks toward me after it is finished, and sit nearby me, turns to me and says, "Why do you keep staring at me, it makes me tremble..."

"You tremble every time you present, don't you?" I said, and she disappeared.

At nightfall, I take her car back home, sitting on the car, I try to keep my body the same speed with the car. And then I turn to her, watch her, my sight incidentally drops to her thigh, her skirt was lifted up a little, revealing a piece of white skin. I put my hand on her thigh, and then her face turns and looks at me in less a second, then she turns back, "You are flirt with me now?"

"No,” I say, “you know it's dangerous if I flirt with you now."

"Why don't you get a car, so I can flirt with you like you did."

"My dad doesn't want to get me a car...” And then my hand drops through her thigh.

It's seven and half when we reach the condo, she puts down all the stuffs, get a towel and walk to the bathroom, take off her clothes, take off the underwear, grabs the shower head and starts to have a shower. I sit on the wet floor, observing her naked body, her skin seems more smooth through the droplets of water. I look at her, and my body begins to burn, I stand up and try to push her into the wall to make love with her, but I am overexerted, my whole body goes through her body and the bathroom wall.

When I turn back to the bathroom, she has already wrapped on her tower and gotten out the bathroom.

This small tiny room makes me annoyed; I go through the wall, reach the outside of the condo. I fly to the sky, but was hit by the invisible wall heavily, my whole body falls down, down to the underground, and finally hit the invisible wall underground. It's dark here, the darkness is going to swallow me, I fly back to the ground rapidly. Standing under the street light, but can't see my own shallow.

21 steps, damn it! I run toward the invisible wall, but my body just bounces back. Why God has to put me here? Why I can't be free even as a ghost!? I start to kick on that invisible wall. Fuck you! Just get me back, I still had lots of time to have fun, lots of money to spend, lots of women to play with...what do you mean by now? Let me stay in a tiny space with an old woman, and can't even having sex, I shouting out loud to the sky, you are fucking playing with me right?

I am exhausted, I am tired with kicking and shouting, I lie down to the floor.

There are no passengers on the street at the night, it is extremely quiet here, sleep on the road is not a good idea, I better go inside and take a good sleep. So I returned to the room, she is talking with the mirror, she leans forward toward the mirror, talks in her soft voice, "How to look enchanting?"

I stand behind her, she is looking at the mirror, and I see her looking at me from the mirror, her eyes are enchanting. Then I recall from that day, we lie on the bed naked, it is daytime, but she puts the curtain on. In the shady room, she suddenly sits on my body, her hair falls down, her eyes look at me soulfully.

"You are enchanting." I said.

She lies her body down.

"Don't do this to other guys."

"I won't."

She takes out her bra through the bed gown, turns off the light, the room is dark now, only a few light beam sneak in. She lies down to the bed, embrace the blanket. I lie down nearby her, try to embrace her, "Hey," Her voice rises to the air, "Even...even you don't love me...but...I will still love you, try...try to love you...I am going to see if I can...can only love you the whole life."

Who is the person she is talking to? Who is the person she is thinking of? I doubt that guy is me, or said I am one hundred percent sure it is me.

She teaches in university every weekday, and she prepares for her lecture every night. On the weekend, she walks, walks alone, everywhere, watches movie alone, eats alone, and this is the kind of life that I would never want to live with. I float in the air, thinking do all dead people are like this? I am thinking who is still alive in this world; Mom is dead two years ago because of cervical cancer, Dad...He sat beside me at the time of the car accident, is he dead? I got a few relatives and a few girlfriends...but why it is her, why I have to follow her after I die?

I can't stand this kind of life, this is not even life.

There is water sound from bathroom, she might be taking a shower. I begin to doing different gymnastic movement at the edge of the circle to shift my focus from the desire to walk in and peeking her naked body. Every time I saw it, it stimulates my arousal, and I became erected, but the thing is I can't do anything, not even masturbate! I can't touch myself! This situation drives me crazy; being dead is much more terrible than being alive.

She walks out the bathroom with the towel wrapped around her naked body, she starts to take on the clothes, I walk out the wall, not allowing myself look at her. When I got back, she is lying on the bed watching her cell phone. I am very bored, so I lie beside her and watch with her. She likes to watch interviews, the successful people talk about their lives, they recall tough life of the past, and then turn out smiling about what they have now. This annoyed me, so I run to the outside of the building wall.

After a while, she walks out the building, seems is going to buy her dinner, and I can only follow her. We pass through the restaurant that she frequently visits, but she didn't stop. Where is she going? Why doesn't she eat here? I can only keep following her, ten minutes after, she reaches a local market, and then lingering on a straight line. Hey, you got stuck like me? Why keep pace up and down? I look at her direction; her eyes are staring at the menu board of food stalls beside. There are three food stalls beside that straight line, one sells pork knuckle, one sells fried rice, one sells green salad. She stops by the pork knuckle stall, seems gonna to buy it, but suddenly she turns back, leaves the stall, and stares at the menu board of the fried rice stall, pondering for a while, then she walks toward the green salad stall...I think she got some kind of decision difficulty syndrome, so I sit on the floor, waiting her to make a final decision.

She took a long time to buy a dinner, this annoys me a lot. On the way back, I just stop in the air, let her drag me. She walks quite slowly, like she is tired from something.

After reaching the condo, she climbs up the stair, reaches the rooftop. The sky is dark now, she turns on the lights, walks to the desk, and then puts the food box on it. Here are many desks and benches made from wood, and obviously people move it around frequently, so they are out of order. The bench she chose is quite far away from the desk, so she tries to move it closer, but she doesn't have enough strength and the bench doesn't move even a little bit. Finally, she gives up, sits down, and puts the food box on her thigh. The moment she opens the food box, I saw a little smile on her face, what she smiles for?

I sit on the bench across her, look at her, her half-wet hair fluttering in the air, and the leaves on the flowerpot start to make sounds. I see, the wind here should be very nice and cool. I look at around; nobody is here. No matter how comfortable the wind is, nobody would like to eat alone on the rooftop. How has she been through the life that are both lonely and alone?

She eats the fried rice quietly, suddenly, she turns her face and looks at my way, at that moment, I thought she sees me, I don't know how to react, but then I found out her eyes are empty, she is in trance. Under the shroud of the darkness, this scene is quite solitary. I change my position, sit beside her, stretch out my hand and hold her arm.

This kind of life continues for several weeks, now I feel like I've already lost my soul, I don't know what I can do, wandering around in the circle of 21 steps radius, no one knows of my existence. I've never felt so frustrated, what the future will be like? Always like this?

Recently she is quite busy, sitting for a long time in front of the computer, working, searching, reading, and practicing speech, but sometimes she just sits and stares at the air.

Today she has been sitting at the computer for a whole day, managing her presenting materials, she is going to have a presentation for her research area. The sky is dark now, I lie on the bed, watch her back, the guitar sounds penetrate through the wall that is so bad in sound-proofing. With the familiar guitar tones, she begins to talk, "Alex, I am really...really...really...missing you..."Her voice is broken. This is the first time I heard somebody calling my name, after I died. I walk to her, look at the tear on her face, she is helpless, me too. I can only pat her shoulder softly. At one moment, I feel so happy; there is someone still cares about me.

I crouch down, look up at her, "I am here, can you hear me?" Only I can hear my voice, and I am surprised by the softness of my voice, I haven't spoken like this for a long time. Her tears do not come out more, it only stays on her eye-pit, but her face expression is extremely miserable...

I don't want to wake up, I speak out loud, "A few minutes! Don't make any noise!" I am half-waking, and hear some constant noises in the room. I sit up on the bed, see her kneeling down and wiping the floor with a damp cloth. She is wearing a thin black dress, her long hair tied up into a ball, her bra loomed up from a dangling neckline. The sweating her is more attractive.

I get up from the bed, walk to her, put my feet to the bucket filled with one third of water, try to imagine a sense of coolness from a hot summer, suddenly, she puts the tack cloth into the bucket, this frighten me, I immediately get my feet out of the bucket. The water that was clean seconds before became muddy, and there are some rubbish floating on the surface.

She gets on the bed, took off the bed sheet, the pillow sheet, grabs both with the blanket, and walks to the cabinet near the closet, takes out a washing powder, grabs some coins on the desk, and then gets out the door. I follow her.

She came to the washing machine on the rooftop, puts the blanket and sheets in, put the coins to the slot, pours down the washing powder, and then closes the top of the machine. She goes back to her room, sits in front of the desk, watches her phone, and then takes out a small bag of Legos, starts to build...

After one hour, the Lego is turning into a small white whale that is swimming on an ocean. She takes the blue whale from the bed-stand, put it in front of the white whale. Now she is building something with the red blocks, like some pattern. I look at it closely, and found out it is a heart shape, and...two letters, at the moment, I realize that's the initial of our names!

What she is doing? She should have known that I am dead.

She looks at her finished work, smiles, looks at the time on cell phone, puts down the Lego, runs to the rooftop, takes the blanket and sheets from the washing machine, puts them to the clothes line nearby, and then goes back to the room. She takes up a carton from the closet and opens it. I feel like I am quite familiar with the stuff inside. A bear doll, a bracelet, a case of color pencils, a small model of Japanese animation character, a necklace...she takes all the stuff out, and then puts them back to the carton one by one, at the last she puts the whales in.

She binds the carton with a ribbon, and then leans down to kiss the carton, staring it for a while, and then put the carton back to the deep down into her closet.

I feel like she is going to let me go, that's good, we are impossible since the beginning, since I was alive…...Is that really good? Do I really want her to let me go or even totally forget me? I feel distracted, lying in the air, and she is now sleeping on the bed. I am thinking it is because of that carton, so I have to stay here? But all of my important stuffs are at my home, by the way, I am stuck with her, not those stuffs. The sun is shining outside, but I feel quite depressive, like I am going to be the small whale that is abandoned in the carton deep down the closet. Those things are her memories, right!? Then, I realize that, maybe I am just like the stuff inside that carton, are only parts of her memories, and one day, when she forgoes it, then I am useless, I will be abandoned...

She gets up from the bed abruptly, walks out the door, and I can only follow her, follow her to upstairs. She reaches the rooftop, stops, looks at the floor, and then let out a long sigh. I watch the place she is looking at, and found out that her blanket and sheets have all fallen down by the wind. "Hahahaha..." I laugh out loud, then feel much better, all the worries and anxious are gone now.

Recently she is quite busy, sitting for a long time in front of the computer, working, searching, reading, and practicing speech, but sometimes she just sits and stares at the air.

I am woken up by a nightmare, in that dream, my computer got virus, I can't open the documents and I lost my backup USB…Wait a minute, this is not my dream, but her dream instead, I turn to her who sleeping beside me, found up my hand is in her head. I immediately move my hand away, there is a worried frown on her face. "Get up, you are having a nightmare." I touch her face and she starts to wake up.

I sit on the seat in auditorium, watch her standing behind the platform and looking at her notes. The auditorium can contain hundreds of people, but now has only around forty to sixty students here.

She starts, at the first she tries to keep her voice stable, and then it is getting better and better. Even though she stutters when she is speaking some proper nouns, but the whole expression is quite clear. The presentation has finished, and now is the question and answer time, many students are interested in her topic, and keep asking questions. Sometimes she takes time to think a while, and then answer the question with a gentle and smooth voice. When she finishes answering, she likes to close her mouth into a straight line, and look at the audience innocently, like waiting to be slaughtered...

The question and answer time is over, the presenter host takes the topic. She then gathers up her notes, gets down the stage quickly, and then walks to the door. I can only follow her, at the same time, I heard a girl says, "This teacher is so cute..."

She seems in a good mood, she didn't buy her dinner in the restaurant nearby, but walks to the food market where are ten more minutes away from here. She bought a fried rice and a yogurt, and came to the rooftop. The desks and benches here are in order now, so she can sit on the bench and reach the table at the same time.

She puts the food box on the desk, opens it, and starts to eat, I can't constrain my curiosity, so I put my hand into her head, and I heard she says, "I am so happy today, I feel like I have found out my life value now..." I could feel her feeling of satisfaction, "Even though I am not quite sure, but seems I could get rid of the thing such as 'He is my life'..." I try to get my hand back, it takes more strength than I usually do, and I see her eyes through my finger; my fingertip is becoming transparent.

I think I get it now, from the satisfaction that I feel from her, I start to realize the meaning of me being here, and start to realize that I am going to disappear.

I sit opposite her, after I got here, I only think about myself, but now I can see her, and I only see her now.

"I love you." I said. Her hands are on the table, so I put my hand on top of her right hand, but she turns her face into the other direction, and keeps staring on the air.

Now I know the feeling of being ignored, being forgotten.

I don't want to wake up, I want to hug her more, I am afraid of being disappeared. She seems has woken up, maybe she feels a bit cold, so she covers her whole body with the blanket. I slip into the blanket.

"The happiest thing in life...is that you can still stay in the warm blanket...after you have woken up..."She says mistily.

I kiss her lip, embrace her, and then falling asleep with her. When she woke up again and opened the curtain, when the sun light exposed on the bed, she will found out that I was disappeared
